Hi whoever reading this!

I'm Indy, 18 years old

I'm super new in web development. I came here from The Odin Project because I'm a self taught warrior lol. Please be kind and wish me luck because people said coding is an as* to deal with and I have no one to ask to.

That's it! Hope everyone have a good day
